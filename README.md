# SkeedgeScript

SkeedgeScript is an accumulative, skeedge-based, esoteric programming language. Here's a simple (if you can call it that) "Hello World!" program in SkeedgeScript:
```
SkeedgE 72
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 101
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 108
SKEeDGE
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 111
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 44
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 32
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 87
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 111
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 114
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 108
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 100
SKEeDGE
SkeedgE 33
SKEeDGE
```
which prints the following:
```Hello, World!```

Since newlines in SkeedgeScript are ignored, all programs can be written on one line.
